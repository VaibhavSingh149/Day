hey how are you I am doing great
updating the whole text thing
I have to write 10 lines probably 
Here I am making edits after my first line of code
let's see where it goes

//Below this will be my third edit
one can insert data into a vim file using "i" and then after they are done,
they are supposed to press ESC and then ":wq" (write and quit) rest it is conditional
